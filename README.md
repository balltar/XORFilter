# XORFilter
Implementing XOR filters in Rust

## To Do: 

- [ ] Determine Types of some hash functions in Rust (both secure and not secure)
- [ ] Hash a row
- [ ] Build a matrix 
  - [ ] Do you build matrix and then solve system or solve system as you go?
- [ ] Might be useful to be able to input an algorithm to solve the system... make a general framework for what inputs to matrix problem are, then have algorithm to solve as a separate input
- [ ] Use TurboMat for matrix computations

- [ ] Make some plan of attack to translate current C code into Rust. Identify primitives or external libraries needed along with necessary algorithms. Would be nice if could make structure a visual diagram or something as ground truth.

- [ ] Understand the entropy bound for filters.
