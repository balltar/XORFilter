# XORFilter
Implementing XOR filters in Rust

## To Do: 

- [ ] Make some plan of attack to translate current C code into Rust. Identify primitives or external libraries needed along with necessary algorithms. Would be nice if could make structure a visual diagram or something as ground truth.

- [ ] Understand the entropy bound for filters.
